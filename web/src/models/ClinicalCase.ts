 * Message is a basic information in the analysis conversation.
 * Each message has a sender, a type, a text, and a payload.
 * The message can be a user question, an agent response, a tool response, or a system message.
 * 
 * For user, agent, and tool messages, they are the results of each step in the analysis conversation. For example:
 * - user: the user's question with a clinical case text
 * - agent: the agent's response with its analysis result
 * - tool: the tool's response with its generated text
 * 
 * For system messages, they are mainly for system notifications to update the UI or to inform the user. More details will be defined in the payload_json.For example:
 * - "event_name": "agent_thinking", indicating the agent is thinking about the analysis result
 * - "event_name": "agent_planning", indicating the agent is planning the analysis result
 * - "event_name": "system_notification", indicating the system has finished the analysis and the result is ready
