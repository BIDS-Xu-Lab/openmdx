With CKD3a (eGFR 35), MRA is not absolutely contraindicated but requires close K/Cr monitoring. <cite>evid_004</cite> <cite>evid_007</cite>\n\n" +
              "## Congestion management & safety net:\n" +
              "- Continue loop diuretic with daily weights and adjust to euvolemia; watch for SGLT2-related volume shifts. Check BMP within 3–7 days after changes. <cite>evid_007</cite> <cite>evid_005</cite>\n" +
              "- During ACEi→ARNI transition, monitor BP, renal function, and potassium closely; counsel on hypotension symptoms. <cite>evid_006</cite> <cite>evid_004</cite>\n\n" +
              "## Diabetes and CKD co-management:\n" +
              "- Maintain metformin at current dose if clinically appropriate; reassess if eGFR declines toward <30. SGLT2 therapy provides CV/renal protection in diabetes with HF. <cite>evid_009</cite> <cite>evid_005</cite>\n" +
              "- For CKD3a, reinforce sick-day rules (hold SGLT2 if poor intake/prolonged fasting/acute illness); monitor electrolytes and renal function during uptitrations. <cite>evid_009</cite> <cite>evid_007</cite>\n\n" +
              "## AF and background therapy:\n" +
              "- Continue anticoagulation (apixaban on board) and statin for ischemic disease as per current regimen; review doses with renal function trends. <cite>evid_003</cite> <cite>evid_007</cite>\n\n" +
              "## Follow-up & monitoring plan:\n" +
              "- Labs: BMP (K/Cr/eGFR/Na) in 3–7 days after SGLT2 start and after ARNI initiation/titrations; repeat with any dose change or symptom shift. <cite>evid_007</cite>\n" +
              "- Clinic review in ~2 weeks to up-titrate ARNI and beta-blocker if stable; reassess volume status, BP, HR, symptoms, and weight trajectory. <cite>evid_004</cite>\n" +
              "- Education: daily weights, salt/fluid guidance, hypotension and dehydration red-flags, rare euglycemic DKA symptoms (seek care if nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain). <cite>evid_009</cite> <cite>evid_005</cite>\n\n" +
              "## Why this plan:\n" +
              "- It implements guideline-directed quadruple therapy for HFrEF with evidence of reduced CV death and HF hospitalization (DAPA-HF, PARADIGM-HF) and guideline preference for ARNI over ACEi when feasible, tailored to this patient's EF 25% and CKD3a. <cite>evid_004</cite> <cite>evid_005</cite> <cite>evid_006</cite> <cite>evid_002</cite> <cite>evid_007</cite>",
